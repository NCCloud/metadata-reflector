## ðŸ›  Development

You can easily run the controller by following these steps:

1) Create a Kubernetes cluster or change the `kubectl` context for the existing one.

```bash
make cluster
```

2) Make changes.
3) Build the controller image and load it into the cluster.

```bash
make docker-build
make docker-load
```

4) Deploy the helm chart with your image. If your changes require updating the Helm chart itself, please open a corresponding PR in this repository https://github.com/NCCloud/charts

```
helm repo add nccloud https://nccloud.github.io/charts
helm install metadata-reflector nccloud/metadata-reflector --set image.tag="0.1.0-dev" # override the tag with the built image
```

Alternatively, configure the environment variables according to [environments.md](environments.md) and run the project.

```bash
export NAMESPACES="default,namespace1" # Metadata Reflector will be limited to these namespaces
go run cmd/manager/main.go
```

5) Destroy the cluster once you are doing testing your changes.

```bash
make cluster-delete
```
